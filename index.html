                <p>I love playing games and it has been my passion for more than 10 years. It's the thing that hurts me the most but never have I wanted to abandon it. I played games until I fucked up my studies, my relationship with family and friends, my life. It got to a point that I questioned myself " are games that bad? Or it's the people around that perceive this way ?" But then, during the tough times, during the lonely times, "games" are always there. Game's a lifelong partner.</br>
