                I love playing games and it has been my passion for more than 10 years. It's the thing that hurts me the most but never have I wanted to abandon it. I played games until I fucked up my studies, my relationship with family and friends, my life. It got to a point that I questioned myself " are game really that harmful? Or it's the people around that thinks games are bad ?" But then, during the tough times, during the lonely times, "games" are always there. Game's a lifelong partner.</br>
