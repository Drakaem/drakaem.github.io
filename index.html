           <u>My Gaming History</u><br/>
           I have played MOBA , fps , rpg and I am currently a battle royale enthusiasm.When I was 5, I was invited by my brother to play mmorpg which demands time and effort to become better(not talking about money here).We played and worked so hard to get ourselves golden equipment(legendary items)in the game.That's where I started enjoy gaming so much.I began playing Counter Strike COndition Zero at 5 years old , then I switched to Risk Your Life ( Role-Playing-Game) and then to dota 1 at 7 years old.</br>

           At the age of 12, Dota2 turned into a free-to-play game and that's where I started bringing my gaming experience to the next stage. My average gaming time was set to about 8 hours a day and my aim was to get better.It was 3 years later that I realized I couldn't play to my full potential So I decided to move on and search for a new game.</br>

           Counter Strike Global Offensive was my new favourite at 2016. I spent money to buy the game and this time I was even more motivated to play as it took me so hard to adjust my pc to fit the requirements of the game(cpu usage was very high).Basically I tried to learn tips and tricks on youtube , get into training map at least 1 hour a day and even buying myself a new microphone just to communicate well with my teammates. I succeeded achieving high rank ( Supreme Master First Class) in about 1 month and it was none other my best fulfillment.</br>

           I then realize I was able to share my knowledge of the game (aiming tips,engaging and peeking advantages and so much more) on youtube . So I created a channel and my youtube career started.It wasn't easy at all.At first , a tutorial video took me around 5 hours to complete and a highlight video of my gameplay took me about 4 hours to finish.And , neither of them shows good quality like the ones that nadeshot , thewarowl did .I felt the impossibility and difficulty so I gave up my youtube . In 2018 , I returned to youtube and this time I wasn't playing csgo anymore.

           I found an underrated fps game,deceit.It is a game of trust and I enjoyed it a lot as it not only requires communication, mechanical skill matters too.The player pool was so small that it was so easy to get paired with top players in the game.The community is friendly and this is what urge me to make videos to popularize the game.The settings was fast-paced and you could really get surprised by the mechanics and the dynamics of the game.</br>

           <u>Current Activity</u></br>
           I am now playing fortnite and making videos of my gameplays.My passion has always been gaming and it never will change.Gaming industries are now paid off with their amazing creations and development as more players,artist,atheletes and even entrepreneurs are getting involved in various countries.The path for gaming is clear and it will become even brighter.I couldn't do much to grow the industry but I know there is one thing I can do.
